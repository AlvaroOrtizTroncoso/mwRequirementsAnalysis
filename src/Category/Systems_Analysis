Wikis can be tremendously useful for systems analysis. Provided (some of) the stakeholders are technical-minded, a wiki can become a resource for discussing use cases, requirements and risks. Use cases, requirements and risks can be captured and prioritized, encouraging an open dialog between stakeholders and developers. Wiki technology is readily available and relatively simple to master, making wikis an effective way to tackle structured tasks (e.g. software development) in a lightweight and open manner and to foster participation by all stakeholders.

However, this openness could potentially lead to an uncontrolled proliferation of different formats and terminology. Enforcing the usage of a set of templates can funnel a collective systems analysis process into a more effective endeavor. The templates in the [[:Category:Systems_Analysis]] category are meant to facilitate this effort.

==Help==
The templates in this category depend on mediawiki (1.15 or greater), ParserFunctions (1.1.1 or greater), Semantic Mediawiki (1.4.3 or greater).
To check which version is installed on your system, please refer to the Special:Version page on your wiki.

* For help on the usage of wiki templates, please see https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Templates
* The ParserFunctions extension is very likely allready installed on your system, or else see https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:ParserFunctions
* For help on installing Semantic Mediawiki, please see http://semantic-mediawiki.org/

;[[Template:Systems_Analysis/Goal|Goal template]]
:This template helps to capture high level objectives of the system. A good goal description should state its purpose unambiguously and should include measurable criteria.

;[[Template:Systems_Analysis/Goal_List|Goal list template]]
:Use this template to dynamically list all the goals in this namespace (requires the Semantic Mediawiki extension).

;[[Template:Systems_Analysis/Stakeholder|Stakeholder template]]
:Use this template to describe stakeholders. Stakeholders are any person (or system) whose work is affected by the project.

;[[Template:Systems_Analysis/Stakeholder_List|Stakeholder list template]]
:Use this template to dynamically list all the stakeholders in this namespace (requires the Semantic Mediawiki extension).
 
;[[Template:Systems_Analysis/Use_Case|Use case template]]
:Use this template to capture use cases. The template provides a set headers that can serve as a checklist, in order to facilitate communication between stakeholders and developers.

;[[Template:Systems_Analysis/Use_Case_List|Use case list template]]
:Use this template to dynamically list all the use cases in this namespace (requires the Semantic Mediawiki extension).

;[[Template:Systems_Analysis/Requirement|Functional requirement template]]
:This template can be of use while writing down functional requirements. Use it as a checklist for completeness and traceability of individual requirements.

;[[Template:Systems_Analysis/Requirement_List|Requirement list template]]
:Use this template to dynamically list all the functional requirements in this namespace (requires the Semantic Mediawiki extension).

;[[Template:Systems_Analysis/Constraint|Constraint template]]
:This template is very similar to the functional requirement template in form, yet it is meant to capture constraints, either enforced by the organization or technology-specific constraints. Non-functional requirements are best captured using this template as well.

;[[Template:Systems_Analysis/Constraint_List|Constraint list template]]
:Use this template to dynamically list all the constraints and non-functional requirements in this namespace (requires the Semantic Mediawiki extension).

;[[Template:Systems_Analysis/Risk|Risk template]]
:Identify a specific risk and an appropriate strategy to manage it.

;[[Template:Systems_Analysis/Risk_List|Risk list template]]
:Use this template to dynamically list all the risks in this namespace (requires the Semantic Mediawiki extension).
