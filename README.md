# mwSystemsAnalysisTemplates
Wikis can be tremendously useful for systems analysis. 
A wiki can become a resource for discussing use cases, requirements and risks. 
Use cases, requirements and risks can be captured and prioritized, encouraging an open dialog between stakeholders and developers. 
Wiki technology is readily available and relatively simple to master, making wikis an effective way to tackle structured 
tasks (e.g. software development) in a lightweight and open manner and to foster participation by all stakeholders.

However, this openness could potentially lead to an uncontrolled proliferation of different formats and terminology. 
Enforcing the usage of a set of templates can funnel a collective systems analysis process into a more effective endeavor. 
The templates bundled here are meant to facilitate this effort.
