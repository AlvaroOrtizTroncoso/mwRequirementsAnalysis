# mwRequirementsAnalysis
A wiki can become a resource for discussing goals, stakeholders, use cases, requirements and risks. 
These can be captured and prioritized, encouraging an open dialog between stakeholders and developers. 
Wiki technology is readily available and relatively simple to master, making wikis an effective way to tackle structured 
tasks (e.g. software development) in a lightweight and open manner and to foster participation by all stakeholders.

However, this openness could potentially lead to an uncontrolled proliferation of different formats and terminology. 
Enforcing the usage of a set of templates, forms, categories and semantic properties can funnel a collective requirements analysis process into a more effective endeavor. 
The ontology packed here is meant to facilitate this effort.
